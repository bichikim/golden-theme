🎨 Golden Theme

Golden Theme was inspired by the background aesthetics of Golden from K-pop Demon Hunters.
This theme is designed to minimize eye strain by eliminating blue tones and instead emphasizing a warm tri-color palette of red, yellow, and green.

Special care was taken to highlight small operator text, ensuring that users can read comfortably without squinting or fatigue, even during long coding sessions.
